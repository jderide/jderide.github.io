I am currently a PhD (c) in Applied Mathematics at University of California, Davis. My academic interests focus on Stochastic Programming, and Stochastic Variational Analysis. I have worked on the development of approximation techniques for solving Stochastic General Equilibrium problems, and their numerical implementation. Additionally, I have collaborated with research groups on Renewal Energies, working on the mathematical modeling of probability distribution of forecast errors for Solar and Wind power generation. Finally, I have been interested in the study of Duality Theory for Stochastic Programming problems, and its connection with approximation techniques.
